Run download_google_roof_images.py. This will create a collection of geotiffs showing available roof patches in roof_tiffs/.

In QGIS, use Raster -> Miscellaneous -> Build Virtual Raster to create oahu_roofs.vrt from all the roof tiffs.

Download Census/Tiger shapefile for U.S. counties (e.g., from https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2016/COUNTY/tl_2016_us_county.zip)
Copy Hawaii counties to new shapefile "/Users/matthias/Dropbox/Research/shared/Switch-Hawaii/switch-hawaii-studies/database/GIS/General/Hawaii Counties.shp"
Vector -> Geometry Tools -> Multipart to Single Part
    Input line or polygon layer: Hawaii Counties
    Output shapfile: /tmp/hawaii_county_parts.shp

Merge two parts of Molokai into one.
Delete small islands (all northwest of Kauai, Ni'ihau and Ka'ula west of Kauai)
Split off Kahoolawe (west of Maui)
Remove unneeded attribute fields.
Label each polygon with island's name.
This gives polygons with about 4 mile buffer offshore.

make grid matching nsrdb grid (0.04 degrees)
Processing Toolbox -> QGIS geoalgorithms -> Vector creation tools -> create grid
    Grid type: Rectangle (**polygon**)
    Grid extent: -159.88, -154.72, 18.83, 22.31 (covers all islands)
    (could use -158.32, -157.64, 21.23, 21.75 (cell centers: -158.3, -157.66, 21.25, 21.73) for Oahu only
    Horizontal spacing: 0.04
    Vertical spacing: 0.04
    Grid CRS: EPSG:4269 or 4326    <- 4326 (WGS84) matches google maps; 4269 (NAD83) matches DEM data, may be more widely used
    Grid: /Users/matthias/Dropbox/Research/shared/Switch-Hawaii/switch-hawaii-studies/database/GIS/General/nsrdb_cell.shp

Use Field Calculator toolbar button to create columns in nsrdb_cell:
    nsrdb_lat (decimal, 7, 2) = (top + bottom)/2
    nsrdb_lon (decimal, 7, 2) = ("left"+"right")/2
    nsrdb_id (int, 6) = @row_number

Intersect nsrdb_cell and load_zones shapefiles, to get NSRDB grid cells within each load zone
Vector -> Geoprocessing Tools -> Intersect
    input vector layer: load_zones
    intersect layer: nsrdb_cell
    Output shapefile: /tmp/load_zone_nsrdb_cell.shp (add to map)

# NOTE: ../General/load_zone_nsrdb_cell.shp could potentially be used instead of 
# ../Utility-Scale Solar Sites/solar_cluster_nsrdb_grid.shp and/or ../Utility-Scale Solar Sites/nsrdb_grid.shp
# This would be especially relevant if the utility-scale solar code switches to automatic clustering
# instead of manual clustering.

Calculate roof area in each cell of load_zone_nsrdb_cell.shp in square meters:
    use Plugins -> Manage Plugins and turn on Zonal Statistics plugin.
    Use Raster -> Zonal Statistics plugin to calculate various statistics for each polygon in load_zone_nsrdb_cell.shp:
        raster layer: oahu_roofs
        polygon layer: load_zone_nsrdb_cell
        output column prefix: cov_
        Statistics to calculate: mean (only)
    (may take 15-30 minutes)
    Project -> Project Properties...
        CRS: "EPSG:26904 - NAD83 / UTM Zone 4N"
    Vector -> Geometry Tools -> Export/Add Geometry Columns...
        Input vector layer: load_zone_nsrdb_cell.shp
        Calculate using: Project CRS
    Select load_zone_nsrdb_cell layer and click on Field Calculator on toolbar
        Create a new field: yes
        Output field name: roof_area
        Output field type: Decimal (15, 3)
        Expression: cov_mean * "AREA"
    Click the pencil on the toolbar to turn off editing mode and save changes

(Alternatively, the step above could use Field Calculator to calculate lz_nc_area = $area, but only if the layer uses lat/lon coordinates; this fails if it uses a UTM coordinate system; see http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/76810/field-calculator-returning-incorrect-length-and-area-values/199194.)

use Processing Toolbox -> QGIS geoalgorithms -> Vector table tools -> Refactor fields to rename fields as follows:
    Input layer: load_zone_nsrdb_cell
    load_zone, nsrdb_id, nsrdb_lat, nsrdb_lon (keep)
    lz_nc_area <- "AREA"
    roof_covg <- cov_mean
    roof_area (keep)
    -> drop all others <-
    Refactored: /Users/matthias/Dropbox/Research/shared/Switch-Hawaii/switch-hawaii-studies/database/GIS/General/load_zone_nsrdb_cell.shp

right-click on layer and choose Save As...
    Format: Comma Separated Values [CSV]
    Save as: /Users/matthias/Dropbox/Research/Shared/Switch-Hawaii/switch-hawaii-studies/database/GIS/General/load_zone_nsrdb_cell.csv
    Separator: comma (default)

Eventually we will cluster nsrdb cells within each load zone into tranches based on hourly capacity factors, weighted by roof_area, and then calculate the average capacity factor for each tranche based on roof_area in each cell.

Screening rules for utility-scale solar projects:
- only zoned for agriculture or country
- no Class A agricultural land
- not golf courses
- not within 50 meters of street centerlines (also filters out rural businesses and neighborhoods)
- not steeper than 10% slope
- allowed patch is at least 60 meters in all directions

Steps to implement these rules (eventually preparing allowed_solar.tif geotiff and solar_cluster_nsrdb_grid_final.csv text file):

download 1/3 arc-second ned data for Oahu area (2 1-degree-square tiles) from "get elevation data" link (http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/basic/?basemap=b1&category=ned,nedsrc&title=3DEP%20View) at http://nationalmap.gov/elevation.html (redirected from http://ned.usgs.gov). I used GridFloat format but other formats would be fine (GeoTIFF doesn't seem to be available)

download the following shape files from http://planning.hawaii.gov/gis/download-gis-data-expanded/ :
"Zoning, C&C of Honolulu" (oahzoning.shp)
"Land Study Bureau Classification (LSB)	" (lsb.shp)
"Roads â€“ C&C of Honolulu" (oah_streets.shp)
"Golf Courses" (golfcourses.shp)

In qgis:
- filter zoning file to only include agricultural and country zones ("ZONING_LAB" IN ('AG-1', 'AG-2', 'COUNTRY'))
- filter land study bureau file to only include class A land ("TYPE" = 'A')

- use Vector -> Geoprocessing Tools -> Difference to subtract class A land from agriculture and country land
- use Vector -> Geoprocessing Tools -> Difference to subtract golf courses (golfcourses.shp) from available land
- use Vector -> Geoprocessing Tools -> Buffer to create 50 meter buffer from centerline of all streets (oah_streets.shp)
- use Vector -> Geoprocessing Tools -> Difference to subtract street buffers from available land
  note: this removes most neighborhoods with homes from the dataset; another option would be to remove all census blocks
  with population density (1000000 * pop10 / $area) > 100 people per km2, but that includes some blocks with large unpopulated parts; 
  that also fails in qgis due to geometry problems with census/tabblock2010_15_pophu.shp
- dissolve features together

remove all polygons smaller than 30 meters across (note: you could probably skip these steps, since the final raster is also cleaned up similarly)
- buffer new layer by -30 meters (Vector -> geoprocessing tools -> buffer)
- buffer this layer by +45 meters; dissolve buffer results (avoid trimming corners of original)
- intersect pre-buffering layer with this new layer to make a trimmed layer ("agriculture and country zoned - not class A or golf course or street 50m - cleaned.shp")

- use Raster -> Miscellaneous -> Merge to combine the two elevation tiles for Oahu
    - set "No data value" to -9999
    - use Creation Options -> High Compression
    - (might be able to avoid the next clipping step by zooming to the right extent and clicking "Use intersected extent" or by adding this to the gdal_merge command: -ul_lr -158.284 21.253 -157.656 21.714 [note: y ordering is opposite from Clipper])
    - this gives: gdal_merge.py -n -9999 -a_nodata -9999 -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE -co PREDICTOR=2 -co ZLEVEL=9 -of GTiff -o "data/Resource Assessment/GIS/Utility-Scale Solar Sites/ned/oahu_dem_merged.tif" "data/Resource Assessment/GIS/Utility-Scale Solar Sites/ned/n22w158/floatn22w158_13.flt" "data/Resource Assessment/GIS/Utility-Scale Solar Sites/ned/n22w159/floatn22w159_13.flt"

- use Raster -> Extraction -> Clipper to trim the elevation raster
    - use the Oahu bounding box: -158.284 to -157.656, 21.253 to 21.714
    - use the same no data value and compression options as the Merge tool
    - edit the command to include compression options from above
    - This gives: gdal_translate -a_nodata -9999 -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE -co PREDICTOR=2 -co ZLEVEL=9 -projwin -158.284 21.714 -157.656 21.253 -of GTiff "data/Resource Assessment/GIS/Utility-Scale Solar Sites/ned/oahu_dem_merged.tif" "data/Resource Assessment/GIS/Utility-Scale Solar Sites/ned/oahu_dem_clipped.tif"

use Raster -> Raster Calculator to perform a dummy calculation on the dem raster, which will round its bounding box to 5 decimal places (in degrees). Otherwise, later operations with the Raster Calculator will do this, and the new rasters won't match the DEM.
    output layer: data/Resource Assessment/GIS/Utility-Scale Solar Sites/ned/oahu_dem_uncompressed.tif
    extent: Current layer extent (from oahu_dem_clipped): -158.28407, -157.65611, 21.25306, 21.71407, 6782 x 4979, EPSG:4269
    raster calculator expression: "oahu_dem_clipped@1"
Note: after using the Raster Calculator, the no_data value will be -3.4028234663852886e+38 (maybe more digits?)

Compress and save the oahu_dem raster with Raster -> Conversion -> Translate:
    Input layer: data/Resource Assessment/GIS/Utility-Scale Solar Sites/ned/oahu_dem_uncompressed.tif
    Output layer: data/Resource Assessment/GIS/Utility-Scale Solar Sites/ned/oahu_dem.tif
    No data: [unchecked; retains nodata value from the original raster]
    Creation Options: High Compression
    
- use Raster -> Analysis -> DEM (Terrain Models) to calculate (approximate) slope for each cell
    - scale = 107447 (based on averaging meters per degree in the x and y directions at 21.5 degrees north): 
      s = 111320 * 0.5 * (1 + cos(latitude*pi/180))
    - Creation Options -> High Compression
    - this gives: 
      gdaldem slope "data/Resource Assessment/GIS/Utility-Scale Solar Sites/ned/oahu_dem.tif" "data/Resource Assessment/GIS/Utility-Scale Solar Sites/ned/oahu_slope_107447.tif" -s 107447.0 -of GTiff -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE -co PREDICTOR=2 -co ZLEVEL=9

- use Raster -> Raster Calculator to create a mask layer identifying flat areas:
    output: oahu_slope_below_10
    extent: click on oahu_slope_107447, then click "Current layer extent"
    formula: 1 / ("oahu_slope_107447@1" <= 10)
    note: in QGIS 2.14, you then have to use the display dialog to set the range to 1:1 (not needed in QGIS 2.10)

- clip using Raster -> Extraction -> Clipper:
    Input file (raster): oahu_slope_below_10.tif 
    Output file: /tmp/allowed_raw.tif
    No data value: 0 (uses 0 for missing data in new file)
    Mask layer: "agriculture and country zoned - not class A or golf course or street 50m - cleaned.shp"
    this gives: gdalwarp -dstnodata 0 -q -cutline "/Users/matthias/Dropbox/Research/Shared/Switch-Hawaii/switch-hawaii-studies/database/GIS/Utility-Scale Solar Sites/planning.hawaii.gov/agriculture and country zoned - not class A or golf course or street 50m - cleaned.shp" -tr 9.25921557063e-05 9.25908817032e-05 -of GTiff "/Users/matthias/Dropbox/Research/Shared/Switch-Hawaii/switch-hawaii-studies/database/GIS/Utility-Scale Solar Sites/ned/oahu_slope_below_10.tif" /tmp/allowed_raw.tif

- invert using Raster -> Conversion -> Translate:
    Input layer: /tmp/allowed_raw.tif
    output: /tmp/allowed_inverted.tif
    No data: 1  (leaves existing no-data=0 as valid values)
    creation options: high compression
    This gives: gdal_translate -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE -co PREDICTOR=2 -co ZLEVEL=9 -a_nodata 1 -of GTiff /tmp/allowed_raw.tif /tmp/allowed_inverted.tif

- shrink allowed boundaries by 3 pixels (30 meters) (to clear out small flat areas):
    Processing Toolbox -> Grass GIS 7 commands -> r.grow
    input: allowed_inverted
    radius: 3.010000 (Euclidian)
    non-null -> 1   (uses 1 for all existing values)
    grown -> 1
    Expanded: [temporary file] (introduces 255 as no-data value)
- Shift back onto original grid (r.grow adds a pixel at the top and left, and shifts the grid slightly)
    Raster -> Raster Calculator
    output: /tmp/allowed_inverted_grown.tif
    extent: (take from allowed_inverted)
    formula: "Expanded@1"
    (this introduces -3.40282e+38 as no-data value, keeps 1 as valid values)
- remove "Expanded" layer from QGIS
- invert using Raster -> Conversion -> Translate:
    input: allowed_inverted_grown
    output: /tmp/allowed_shrunk
    No data: 1  (treats 1 as no-data; leaves existing no-data=-3.40282e+38 as valid values)
    creation options: high compression
- expand allowed areas back to original boundaries (or maybe slightly further):
    Processing Toolbox -> Grass GIS 7 commands -> r.grow
    input: allowed_solar_shrunk
    radius: 4.250000 (Euclidian)    (just enough to reach original corners without picking up slivers from regions one pixel away)
    non-null -> 1
    grown -> 1
    Expanded: [temporary file]
    (switches to 255 as no-data value, 1 as valid data)
- Shift back onto original grid and filter out extra areas that got added during regrowth
    Raster -> Raster Calculator
    output: data/Resource Assessment/GIS/Utility-Scale Solar Sites/allowed_solar.tif
    extent: (take from allowed_raw)
    formula: "Expanded@1" * "allowed_raw"
    (switches to -3.40282e+38 as no-data value, keeps 1 as valid values)    
    (these are the solar-suitable raster cells)    


- use Processing Toolbox -> SAGA -> Raster calculus -> Raster Calculator to create rasters of latitude and longitude based on allowed_solar.tif. Use ypos() and xpos() functions for these. Create as temporary files, then use QGIS Raster Calculator to shift back onto standard grid and save as allowed_solar_latitude and allowed_solar_longitude.
- use Processing Toolbox -> SAGA -> Raster Tools -> Reclassify values to create raster showing coverage of suitable cells (0 or 1 for each pixel)
    Grid: allowed_solar
    Method: single
    old value: -9999
    new value: 0.0
    operator: <=    (QGIS uses -3.4028234663852886e+38 as no-data value, so this will select those)
    replace no data values: yes
    new value for no data values: 0.0     (this is probably redundant with the settings above)
    replace other values: no      (or you could set them to 1)
    Reclassified grid: [Save to temporary file]
- use Raster Calculator to shift back to original grid and save as allowed_solar_coverage.tif

draw polygons around clusters of solar-suitable cells; assign each a unique ID; save as solar_clusters.shp

# NOTE: ../General/load_zone_nsrdb_grid.shp could potentially be used instead of 
# solar_cluster_nsrdb_grid.shp and/or nsrdb_grid.shp.
# This would be especially relevant if the utility-scale solar code switches to automatic clustering
# instead of manual clustering.

make grid matching nsrdb grid (0.04 degrees)
Processing -> QGIS geoalgorithms -> Vector creation tools -> create grid
    Grid type: Rectangle (**polygon**)
    Grid extent: -158.32, -157.64, 21.23, 21.75 (cell centers: -158.3, -157.66, 21.25, 21.73)
    Horizontal spacing: 0.04
    Vertical spacing: 0.04
    Grid CRS: EPSG:4269 (NAD 93)   <- matches NED data
    Grid: data/Resource Assessment/GIS/Utility-Scale Solar Sites/nsrdb_grid.shp

Use Field Calculator toolbar button to create columns in nsrdb_grid:
    nsrdb_lat (decimal, 7, 2) = (top + bottom)/2
    nsrdb_lon (decimal, 7, 2) = ("left"+"right")/2
    nsrdb_id (int, 6) = @row_number

Make solar_cluster_nsrdb_grid.shp:
    Vector -> Geoprocessing Tools -> Intersect...
    Input vector layer: nsrdb_grid.shp
    Intersect layer: solar_clusters.shp
    Output shapfile: data/Resource Assessment/GIS/Utility-Scale Solar Sites/solar_cluster_nsrdb_grid.shp
    
Assign unique IDs for each polygon in solar_cluster_nsrdb_grid:
    Select solar_cluster_nsrdb_grid layer and click on Field Calculator on toolbar
    Create a new field: yes
    Output field name: gridclstid
    Output field type: Integer (7)
    Expression: @row_number

Calculate solar area in each polygon of solar_cluster_nsrdb_grid.shp in square meters:
    use Plugins -> Manage Plugins and turn on Zonal Statistics plugin.
    Use Raster -> Zonal Statistics plugin to calculate various statistics for each polygon in solar_cluster_nsrdb_grid.shp:
        raster layer: allowed_solar_latitude, allowed_solar_longitude or allowed_solar_coverage (gives percent coverage)
        polygon layer: solar_cluster_nsrdb_grid
        output column prefix: lat_, lon_ or cov_
        Statistics to calculate: mean (only)
        # note: this seems to work well, but produces some false non-null values for lat and lon (coverage=0 in these cases)    
    Project -> Project Properties...
        CRS: "EPSG:26904 - NAD83 / UTM Zone 4N"
    Vector -> Geometry Tools -> Export/Add Geometry Columns...
        Input vector layer: solar_cluster_nsrdb_grid.shp
        Calculate using: Project CRS
    Select solar_cluster_nsrdb_grid layer and click on Field Calculator on toolbar
        Create a new field: yes
        Output field name: solar_area
        Output field type: Decimal (15, 3)
        Expression: cov_mean * "AREA"
    Click the pencil on the toolbar to turn off editing mode and save changes

(Alternatively, the step above could use Field Calculator to calculate gc_area = $area, but only if the layer uses lat/lon coordinates; this fails if it uses a UTM coordinate system; see http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/76810/field-calculator-returning-incorrect-length-and-area-values/199194.)

Eventually we will use solar areas and mean lat/lon for each polygon to calculate the mean lat/lon for each solar cluster; they will also be used to weight the capacity factors calculated for each nsrdb cell

use Processing Toolbox -> QGIS geoalgorithms -> Vector table tools -> Refactor fields to rename fields as follows:
    Input layer: solar_cluster_nsrdb_grid
    gridclstid, nsrdb_id, cluster_id, nsrdb_lat, nsrdb_lon (keep)
    lat_mean -> solar_lat
    lon_mean -> solar_lon
    cov_mean -> solar_covg
    gc_area or "AREA" -> gc_area
    solar_area (keep)
    -> drop all others <-
    Refactored: solar_cluster_nsrdb_grid_final.shp
right-click on layer and choose Save As...
    Format: Comma Separated Values [CSV]
    Save as: data/Resource Assessment/GIS/Utility-Scale Solar Sites/solar_cluster_nsrdb_grid_final.csv
    Separator: comma (default)
